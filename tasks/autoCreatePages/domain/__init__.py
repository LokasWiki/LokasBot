"""
Domain layer package.

This package contains the core business logic of the autoCreatePages task,
following Domain-Driven Design principles. It includes:

- entities: Core business objects (Page, Category)
- repositories: Abstract interfaces for data access
- use_cases: Application-specific business rules

This layer is independent of infrastructure concerns and contains
only pure business logic.
