# Football Player Data Translation Bot - Arabic Wikipedia

## Observer Pattern: Monitoring and Error Handling

- [x] Implement an Chain of Responsibility Pattern to monitor the bot's progress and detect errors.
- [x] Set up error handling mechanisms for each stage of the bot's operation.
- [x] Create a logging system to record errors and progress.

## Pipeline Pattern: Structured Data Processing

- [X] Data Extraction Stage from English Wikipedia:
  - [X] Identify English Wikipedia articles with Infobox football biography templates.
  - [X] Configure the wikitext parsing library for English.
  - [X] Extract data from the English Infobox template and organize it.

- [ ] Translation Stage (Using Custom Array):
  - [ ] Create a custom translation array mapping English keys to Arabic keys.
  - [ ] Implement a translation function using the custom array.

- [ ] Template Integration Stage on Arabic Wikipedia:
  - [ ] Identify target Arabic Wikipedia articles and corresponding templates.
  - [ ] Set up the wikitext parsing library for Arabic Wikipedia.
  - [ ] Parse the Arabic article wikitext and extract the Arabic template.
  - [ ] Integrate the translated and translated data into the Arabic template.

- [ ] Error Handling and Quality Assurance Stage:
  - [ ] Implement quality checks for translations and integrated data.
  - [ ] Ensure accurate and contextually appropriate integration.

## Decorator Pattern: Quality Assurance

- [ ] Implement quality checks as decorators for translation and integration stages.
- [ ] Validate translations and integrated data for accuracy and context.

## Template Method Pattern: Bot Operation Structure

- [ ] Design a template method for the entire bot operation:
  - [ ] Extract data from English Wikipedia articles.
  - [ ] Translate data using the custom array.
  - [ ] Integrate translated data into Arabic Wikipedia templates.
  - [ ] Perform error handling and quality assurance.
  - [ ] Log progress and errors through the observer pattern.

## Testing and Iteration

- [ ] Test the bot operation on a small subset of articles.
- [ ] Identify and address issues with data extraction, translation, or template integration.
- [ ] Iterate based on testing results and feedback.

## Automation and Scaling (Optional)

- [ ] Evaluate the feasibility of automating the bot for a larger number of articles.
- [ ] Develop automation scripts or tools, considering Wikipedia's guidelines and rate limits.
- [ ] Strategize to manage potential server load and ensure adherence to Wikipedia's rules.

## Documentation and Reporting

- [ ] Document the bot's operation, including setup, implementation, and usage instructions.
- [ ] Prepare a report summarizing the project, challenges encountered, and solutions applied.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- [ ] Review and adhere to Wikipedia's terms of use and guidelines for bot operation and content modification.
- [ ] Ensure compliance with relevant data protection and copyright regulations.

## Project Completion

- [ ] Conduct a final review of the bot's operation and components.
- [ ] Ensure that all tasks are completed and thoroughly tested.
- [ ] Conclude the project, including documentation and any required reporting.
